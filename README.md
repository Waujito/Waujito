## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vetrov Vadim and I am a programmer :) 

Currently I identify myself primarily as a backend developer. It is too interesting for me to build complicated services and maintain them.
I have been working with such modern computer science tools as C/C++, Linux, Docker, Python. Also I have a little bit experience with TypeScript (Vue.js) and Java (Spring Boot).

Check up my github repositories if you want to find out more about my stack.
You can reach me via my telegram: [@waujito](https://t.me/waujito) or email: [vetrovvd@gmail.com](mailto:vetrovvd@gmail.com)
