## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vetrov Vadim and I am a programmer :) 

Currently I'm in a stage of intensive learning modern computer science tools, such as Python, TypeScript(Vue.js) and Java(SpringBoot). Not for a long time ago I started to study the disciplines of machine learning and data analysis. 

Feel free to find out more about me on my personal website: [https://waujito.github.io](https://waujito.github.io/
You can reach me via my telegram: [@waujito](https://t.me/waujito) or email: [vetrovvd@gmail.com](mailto:vetrovvd@gmail.com)

I am looking forward for new opportunities and internships!
