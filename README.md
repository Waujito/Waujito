## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Waujito. Real name is Vetrov Vadim.

I am engaged in programming because it is a really fun and cool hobby for me. I really love it ðŸ’–

I'm currelntly working on a large project called AMFi bot.
A bot for messengers that allows you to moderate chat very easily.

I'm currently learning programming languages such as Python, PHP(with Laravel), TypeScript(with Vue.js) and C#(ASP.NET)
