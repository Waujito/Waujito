## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Waujito. (Real name is Vetrov Vadim.)

I am engaged in programming because it is quite funny and cool for me. I really love it ðŸ’–

I'm currelntly working on a large project called AMFi bot. It is a bot for messengers that allows you to moderate chat with ease and joy.

Also, I'm in a stage of intensive learning modern computer science tools, such as Python, C#(ASP.NET) and TypeScript(Vue.js).

Feel free to find out more about me on my personal website: [https://waujito.github.io](https://waujito.github.io/)
In addition, you can reach me via my telegram: [@waujito](https://t.me/waujito) or email: [vetrovvd@yandex.ru](mailto:vetrovvd@yandex.ru)

I am looking forward for new opportunities and internships!
